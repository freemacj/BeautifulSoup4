# BeautifulSoup4
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.

# Getting Started
We are going to use Python as our scraping language, together with a simple and powerful library, BeautifulSoup4.

- For Mac users, Python is pre-installed in OS X. Open up Terminal and type `python --version` You should see your python version is 2.7.x.

- For Windows users, please install Python through the [official website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Next we need to get the BeautifulSoup library using `pip`, a package management tool for Python.

In the terminal, type:

    easy_install pip
    pip install BeautifulSoup4
    
<b>Note:</b> If you fail to execute the above command line, try adding `sudo` in front of each line.
